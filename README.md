# ProcessManager
Lightweight, easy-to-use command-line task manager. It's time to ditch taskkill and tasklist.

PRM is the main project. It is the command-line task manager, written in C#. Needs many more improvements.
SUDO is a standalone that summons PRM, to execute something with administrator priviledge, mimicking Linux's SUDO.

SYS (abandoned) is side project, which meant to simplify calling shell commands from prm.
